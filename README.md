## PROBLEMS
- Ever increasing population adding more waste everyday
- India generates 62 million tonnes of waste
- Contamination of  land, water and food
- Poor segregation of recyclable and non-recyclable waste  
- Improper disposal of e-waste
- Lack of Industry experts
and properly trained employees


## PROJECT APPROACH AND IMPLEMENTATION
- Installing Microchips in smart bins to monitor if the bin is full or not. 
- When the bin is full, the sensor signals are read and a route is set up to clear the clutter. 
- The bing maps API is integrated to our web application which provied the most efficient route. 
- The users can take picture of the area of concern and send it via our whatsapp bots which are multi-lingual. 
- Later, these images are sent to the respective people in charge via Azure Cloud Shell and Azure Blob Storage. 
- Smart Bins segregate recyclable waste using AI based object-recognition and these are sent to recycle plants. 
- High quality goods are made out of the recyclable waste and put on sale in our app. 
- The reward points people get while using the app can be redeemed by buying products. 
- Safe disposal of all toxic(e-waste, medical waste) and non-toxic waste is made sure with the help of gps tracking.
